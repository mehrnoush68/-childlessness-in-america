# Understanding the Landscape of Childlessnessin the U.S.: A Data-Driven Exploration (50-Year Trends)

## Abstract

This paper investigates trends in childlessness in the United States from 1970 to 2022. Data from the General Social Survey (GSS) is analyzed to consider factors like age, gender, education, class, and number of children. The analysis reveals a consistent rise in childlessness across various demographics, potentially linked to economic considerations, educational attainment, and shifting social norms. The paper explores the potential social and economic implications of this trend, highlighting the need for further research to navigate the complexities surrounding childlessness in today's society.
